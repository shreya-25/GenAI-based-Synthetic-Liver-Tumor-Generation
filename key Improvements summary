V2 changes made ------------

Here are the key improvements needed in GANTraining.py: Critical fixes:

Enforce tumor-specific loss - Add a loss term that specifically encourages dark tumor regions:
Add a tumor region intensity loss that penalizes weak contrast
Use gradient magnitude loss to enforce sharp tumor boundaries

Better normalization - The current HU normalization might be washing out tumor intensity:
Consider using a more aggressive normalization that preserves tumor contrast
Or use separate normalization for tumor vs background regions

Patch selection - Extract patches with higher tumor contrast:
Filter patches based on minimum intensity difference between tumor and background
Ensure extracted patches have visible, high-contrast tumors

Architecture improvements:
Add skip connections to preserve fine details
Use attention mechanisms focused on tumor regions
Increase network capacity in the final layers

Loss function enhancement:
Add L1 loss on tumor regions specifically
Add edge-preserving loss for tumor boundaries
Use a discriminator that focuses on tumor texture, not just overall appearance
